I've had the great opportunity to collaborate with amazing people on a diverse
set of projects, from Open Source libraries to large-scale applications.

## [GraphQL-ESLint](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/eslint/docs)

I discovered this plugin and fallen in love in potential of linting both schema
and operations with ESLint although code files. Unfortunately it had too many
issues and false positive reports, I started by fixing them all and got the job
with [The Guild](https://the-guild.dev) thanks to my amazing contributions. I led v2/v3/v4 releases.

## [GraphQL.ORG](https://graphql.org)

I led the
[migration](https://graphql.org/blog/2024-06-11-announcing-new-graphql-website)
from Gatsby to Next.js for the official GraphQL website. I also helped with
work for conference pages for [2023](https://graphql.org/conf/2023) and
[2024 year](https://graphql.org/conf/2024).

## [Nextra](https://nextra.site)

I joined development of [Nextra 2](https://the-guild.dev/blog/nextra-2) and led
[Nextra 3](https://the-guild.dev/blog/nextra-3) and
[Nextra 4](https://the-guild.dev/blog/nextra-4).

## [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)

I led GraphiQL 3 release, I improved code linting, fixed rerendering by
compiling source code with
[React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler), migrated to
[Vite](https://vite.dev) and implemented POC of
[Monaco-Editor integration](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/pull/3234).

## [GraphQL Hive](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive)

I implemented first version of front for Hive App. I improved laboratory page
which uses GraphiQL by adding Operation Collection plugin,
[Tabs support](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/product-updates/2024-10-11-laboratory-improvements)
and
[Preflight Script plugin](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/product-updates/2024-12-27-preflight-script).
