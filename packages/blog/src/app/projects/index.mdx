# Projects

I've had the great opportunity to collaborate with amazing people on a diverse
set of projects, from Open Source libraries to large-scale applications.

### [<GraphQLESLintLogo className="align-text-top mr-3" />GraphQL ESLint](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/eslint/docs)

I discovered this plugin and fallen in love in potential of linting both schema
and operations with ESLint although code files. It had too many issues and false
positive reports, I started by fixing them all and got the job with
[The Guild](https://the-guild.dev) thanks to my amazing contributions. Led its
development for {new Date().getFullYear() - 2021} years.

### [<TheGuildLogo className="h-8 inline mr-3" />The Guild Docs](https://the-guild.dev)

I maintained and improved DX and UX documentation for The Guild projects. All
ecosystem websites are hosted on their own GitHub repos, and all merged into a
single website https://the-guild.dev.

### [<TheGraphLogo className="h-8 inline mr-3" />The Graph Docs](https://thegraph.com/docs)

I migrated The Graph docs from homemade solution to [Nextra](#nextra) 2 and 3
with powerful i18n support for 10+ languages site and remote MDX rendering for
some pages, fetched from GitHub.

### [<span style={{ color: 'color(display-p3 0.8824 0 0.5961)' }}><GraphQLLogo className="h-8 inline mr-3" />GraphQL.org</span>](https://graphql.org)

I led the
[migration](https://graphql.org/blog/2024-06-11-announcing-new-graphql-website)
from Gatsby to Next.js for the official GraphQL website. I also helped with work
for conference pages for [2023](https://graphql.org/conf/2023) and
[2024 year](https://graphql.org/conf/2024).

### [<NextraLogo className="h-6 inline" />](https://nextra.site)

I joined development of [Nextra 2](https://the-guild.dev/blog/nextra-2) and led
[Nextra 3](https://the-guild.dev/blog/nextra-3) and
[Nextra 4](https://the-guild.dev/blog/nextra-4) releases. I added remote MDX
rendering, App Router and Turbopack support, dynamic TOC, `_meta.js` files,
improved bundle size and many more.

### [<span style={{ color: 'color(display-p3 0.8824 0 0.5961)' }}><GraphQLLogo className="h-8 inline mr-3" />Graph<i className="px-px">i</i>QL</span>](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)

I led GraphiQL 3 release, I improved code linting, fixed rerendering with
compiling source code with
[React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler), migrated to
[Vite](https://vite.dev) and implemented POC of
[Monaco-Editor integration](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/pull/3234).

### [<HiveLogo className="h-7 inline text-[#00342c] dark:text-white" />](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive) [#graphql-hive]

I implemented first version of web application for GraphQL Hive. I improved
laboratory page which uses [GraphiQL](#graphiql) by adding Operation Collection
plugin,
[Tabs support](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/product-updates/2024-10-11-laboratory-improvements)
and
[Preflight Script plugin](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/product-updates/2024-12-27-preflight-script).
