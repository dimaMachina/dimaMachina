# Projects

I've had the great opportunity to collaborate with amazing people on a diverse
set of projects, from Open Source libraries to large-scale applications.

### [<GraphQLESLintLogo className="align-text-top mr-3" />GraphQL ESLint](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/eslint/docs)

I discovered this plugin and fell in love with its potential to lint both schema
and operations using ESLint, even in code files. However, it had too many issues
and false positives. I started by fixing them **all** and, thanks to my
contributions, landed a job with [The Guild](https://the-guild.dev). I'm leading
its development for {new Date().getFullYear() - 2021} years.

### [<TheGuildLogo className="h-8 inline mr-3" />The Guild Docs](https://the-guild.dev)

I maintained and improved DX and UX documentation for The Guild projects. Each
ecosystem website is hosted in its own GitHub repository and merged into a
single website: https://the-guild.dev.

### [<TheGraphLogo className="h-8 inline mr-3" />The Graph Docs](https://thegraph.com/docs)

I migrated The Graph docs from a homemade solution to [Nextra](#nextra) 2 and 3,
enabling powerful i18n support for a 10+ language site and remote MDX rendering
for some pages fetched from GitHub

### [<span style={{ color: 'color(display-p3 0.8824 0 0.5961)' }}><GraphQLLogo className="h-8 inline mr-3" />GraphQL.org</span>](https://graphql.org)

I led the
[migration](https://graphql.org/blog/2024-06-11-announcing-new-graphql-website)
of the official GraphQL website from Gatsby to Next.js. I also contributed to
the conference pages for [2023](https://graphql.org/conf/2023) and
[2024](https://graphql.org/conf/2024).

### [<NextraLogo className="h-6 inline" />](https://nextra.site) [#nextra]

I joined the development of [Nextra 2](https://the-guild.dev/blog/nextra-2) and
led the releases of [Nextra 3](https://the-guild.dev/blog/nextra-3) and
[Nextra 4](https://the-guild.dev/blog/nextra-4). I added remote MDX rendering,
App Router and Turbopack support, a dynamic TOC, `_meta.js` files, improved the
bundle size, and much more.

### [<span style={{ color: 'color(display-p3 0.8824 0 0.5961)' }}><GraphQLLogo className="h-8 inline mr-3" />Graph<i className="px-px">i</i>QL</span>](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)

I led the release of GraphiQL 3, improved code linting, fixed rerendering by
compiling source code with the
[React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler), migrated the project
to [Vite](https://vite.dev), and implemented a proof of concept for
[Monaco-Editor integration](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/pull/3234).

### [<HiveLogo className="h-7 inline text-[#00342c] dark:text-white" />](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive) [#graphql-hive]

I implemented the first version of the frontend for the GraphQL Hive web application. I
improved the Laboratory page, which uses [GraphiQL](#graphiql), by adding the
Operation Collection plugin,
[tabs support](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/product-updates/2024-10-11-laboratory-improvements),
and the
[Preflight Script plugin](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/hive/product-updates/2024-12-27-preflight-script).
