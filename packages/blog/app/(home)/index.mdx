# About Dima

I was born in Kharkiv, Ukraine 🇺🇦, and lived there for 20 years before
emigrating to Paris, France 🇫🇷, where I spent 11 years. Now, I'm embracing
digital nomadism 🏖️.

I am a maintainer of the following open-source projects:

- [graphql-eslint](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/eslint/docs)
- [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)
- [Nextra](https://nextra.site)
