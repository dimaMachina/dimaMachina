# About Dima

<Callout type="info">
After three years at [The Guild](https://the-guild.dev), I am looking for new job opportunities or available for consulting based on my experience with React, Next.js and GraphQL.

I can help you with anything related to:

- React, Next.js, Webpack, and Turbopack plugins
- MDX, parsing, and custom plugins
- React Compiler optimizations and app performance
- Linting and custom validation rules for ESLint or GraphQL

</Callout>

I was born in Kharkiv, Ukraine 🇺🇦, and lived there for 20 years before
emigrating to Paris, France 🇫🇷, where I spent 11 years. Now, I'm embracing
digital nomadism 🏖️.

I am a maintainer of the following open-source projects:

- [Nextra](https://nextra.site)
- [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)
- [graphql-eslint](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/eslint/docs)
